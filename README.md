# code-to-calculate-the-Binomial-Coefficient-C-n-r-using-the-formula-C-n-r-r-n-r-n-
This program calculates the Binomial Coefficient \(C(n, r)\) using the formula \(C(n, r) = n! / (r! \cdot (n - r)!)\). It includes functions for factorial calculation and validation to ensure \(r \leq n\). Enter values for `n` and `r` to compute the result. Ideal for combinatorics applications.
