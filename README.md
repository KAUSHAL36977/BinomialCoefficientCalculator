Binomial Coefficient Calculator

This program calculates the Binomial Coefficient , which represents the number of ways to choose r items from a set of n items without regard to the order.

Formula

Features

Factorial Calculation: Uses a helper function to compute the factorial of a number.

Binomial Coefficient Calculation: Computes the coefficient using the formula above.

Input Validation: Ensures  before performing calculations.

User-Friendly: Accepts input for n and r and displays the result clearly.

How to Use

Clone the repository or download the source code.

Compile the program using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++):

g++ binomial_coefficient.cpp -o binomial_coefficient

Run the program:

./binomial_coefficient

Enter values for n and r when prompted.

Example

Input:

Enter n and r: 5 2

Output:

Binomial coefficient for n = 5 and r = 2 is: 10
